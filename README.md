# 14 Days, 14 Vanilla Web Apps [HTML + CSS + JS]

---

A tiny challenge I'm taking to build 15 simple vanilla web apps in 14 days using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

*Why not 15?* Well, the simple answer is I couldn't come up with a 15th idea that fit the theme.

The primary focus of this challenge is JavaScript as I wanted each project to have functionality, though HTML and CSS have also been used to make the apps visually pleasing. They are not however guaranteed to be mobile responsive due to the limited time constraints.

| Day | App | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Eisenhower Decision Matrix | Task prioritization with eisenhower method. |
| 02 | Countdown Timer | Set a countdown (hrs, mins, seconds). |
| 03 | To-Do List | Simple task manager. |
| 04 | Date Distance Calculator | Calculate the number of days between two dates. |
| 05 | Motivational Quotes | Random quotes to motivate. |
| 06 | Hex Clock | A clock that uses the time for the background. |
| 07 | Ninja Name | Find your ninja name. |
| 08 | Rot-13 | Encode/Decode text with Rot-13. |
| 09 | Stopwatch | A stopwatch with laps. |
| 10 | Rock, paper, scissors | Play against the computer. |
| 11 | Percentages Calculator | A percentage calculation utility. |
| 12 | Web Notepad | A notepad for the web. |
| 13 | Text Patterns | Long spam text patterns generator. |
| 14 | Expense Tracker | Simple expenses tracking. |

### Give it a try!

I encourage you to try something similar! Challenges are a great way to learn as well as improve your abilities. You can use this repository as a reference and try to create 10-15 tiny but useful web apps in the same amount of days. For an added challenge, try coming up with new ideas or add new features to the existing web apps.

### Dedicated projects

Some of the projects I've made as part of this challenge were worthy of adding more to and have been turned into fully-fledged repositories of their own.
